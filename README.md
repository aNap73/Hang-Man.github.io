So this is what happens when a police officer pulls over a zombie for driving while dead!

Lot's of fun here, hand drawn gif animations, alot of work on sound design, and a fun little game and set of data for the game.

This was a lot of fun, not sure what was better writting it or playing it.

I was really proud of ensuring that all of my projects were mobile ready. The keyboard on this project was a great little hack to get around mobile keyboards by rolling my own.
